This Friday, my friends and I built a small unity game called Publiclash for Hacker Night, a warm-up before VandyHacks II. Publiclash is a one-on-one shooting game where the player who gets most points from hitting the target wins. Our game won the first place after a vote. The prize is a MINECRAFT light-up redstone ore.

It looks awesome! Though to open the battery compartment I'll need a screwdriver, which I don't have. After experimenting with a variety of tools (credit cards, coins, scissors, forks, paper clips, you name it...), I just decided to let the ore sit there for a while...
