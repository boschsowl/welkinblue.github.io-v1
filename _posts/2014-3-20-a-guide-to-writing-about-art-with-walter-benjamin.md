In my Western Civilization class today, we were introduced to a critique written by Walter Benjamin, a German philosophor who had tremendous influence on 20th century western art and aesthetic theory.

This critique stays true to his reputation:

> A Klee painting named Angelus Novus shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.

Beautifully written and brings a vivid rendering of the angel to my mind. Out of curiosity I decided to look it up - the real painting must be far more stunning than what I have imagined it to be. So I googled Angelus Novus...

Turns out Benjamin purchased a Swiss-German painter, Paul Klee's drawing of the Angel fo History in 1921 for quite a fortune, and it remained his most prized possession.

### It certainly is a very interesting drawing...
<br>

#### Just a bit different from what I have pictured...
<br>

### It looks like...
<br>

#### Wait, are you sure about this?
<br>

### Okay.
<br>

#### It's not too late to say no.
<br>

### Since you are so curious...
<br>

#### After all this is a world of possibilities...
<br>

### There you go.

Walter Benjamin would probably make a very successful commercial designer if he was still alive today...
