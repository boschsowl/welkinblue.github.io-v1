Snappy is part of STORM Lab's eSMAC project I'm working on. It's an educational modular robot for high school STEM courses. It comes with different modules, including a rechargeable battery, a BLE module, a barometer, a temperature sensor and a gyroscope. Snappy can be used to teach students basic programming, or it can be put in a water rocket (which is often used in a high school physics class) to measure the height and speed of the rocket.

My supervisor, Eka, the post doc of our lab participated in Your IoT | Connected World Contest with Snappy in July and won a prize of $10k of component to spend on Digikey.

For more details of the robot, here is the award-winning video of [Snappy](http://youriotcontest.com/entry/9296391)
