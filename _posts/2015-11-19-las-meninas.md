This is Velázquez's Las Meninas. Created during High Baroque period in Spain, ca. 1640-65, this masterpiece now resides in Museo Prado, Madrid. Velázquez not only incorporated all Renaissance and Baroque techniques in it, he also revolutionized the idea of what art can convey. This painting also promoted him to a high social status, therefore is certainly a great piece of art.

In the center, the Infanta Margarita is accompanied by two maids of honor, Isabel and Maria, one offering her water, the other courtesying. Next to them, Velázquez himself is holding a painting brush and a palatte. In the foreground, we see the Infanta's favorite dwarfs, one of them putting a foot on the royal family's dog. The dog's calm reactions indicates the close relationship between the family and the dwarfs. Behind them, there is a court lady dressed like a widow, and Diego Luiz, a chaperone. In the far back, Don José, the chamberlain is frozen in his movement, about to enter a doorway. To his right, a mirror reflects King Philip IV and Queen Mariana, also his niece (interesting history of the Habsburg family). All of our subjects are in Velázquez's studio in the Royal Alcázar Palace.

In this painting, Velázquez demonstrates many typical Baroque characteristics. He uses a certain degree of tenebrism, casting spolight on his subjects, especially the Infanta. They are brightly illuminated against the dark background. This dramatic contrast between light and dark draws the viewer into the scene. He also created strong diagonals in the pictures, which add to the dramatic effect. Don José in the back is about to turn; he is rendered as in the middle of a movement, giving viewers a sense of anticipation. He also stands out from the brightly illuminated doorway, which makes him stands out particularly. Most subjects are looking at the viewers as the latter look at them. This mutual awareness is very subtle. Velázquez brings interactions in Baroque art to a new level: he created an extension of pictorial depth in both directions. The doorway and the ascending staircase creates a space that leads viewers back; the outward glances incorporate the viewers' space into the picture.

Moreover, Velázquez's work also distinguishes itself from other Baroque compositions in that he adopts many innovative techniques. He uses impasto, applying very thick paint at certain places to create realistic textures. For instance, the Infanta's silver, shiny dress displays a smooth, light and glittering texture, because the artist carefully applied thick and short strokes. We can even see the buttons on her chest. Velázquez also uses different strokes at other places. For instance, thinenr strokes are used to render the girl's thin, smooth hair. Velázquez's attention to these details made him a great child portrait painter. In the mirror reflection of the royal couple, we can see a red drapery over their heads, which implies that they are at the viewers' position, posing for a portrait. This is because red draperies were common in royal or noble portraits. Here, Velázquez wants to tell that the mirror reflects both the portrait he's painting and the real people. He wants to convey that his paintings are indistinguishable from real subjects. Further, it is also hard to tell the border between his hand and the painting brush he's holding - he wants to show that his skills are so extraordinary that the pen is onlyl a natural extension of his hand. These clever implications are unique to Velázquez, therefore making this painting a classic.

It is worth noticing that this painting was not commissioned by the royal family. At the time of the painting, Velázquez wanted to promote himself and his profession. More specifically, Velázquez wanted to join the Order of Santiago, an order of knights that only accpeted those of noble lineage. As a commoner artist, Velázquez decided to "paint his way in." He used his art, especially Las Meninas to promote himself; thus the implication of his skills in the painting as previously explained. He did obtain the membership of the Order eventually, and to mark this triumph, he added the Order's red insignia of a dagger and a cross to his chest in the painting. This painting was possible also because King Philip IV was a generous patron of art and had a good relationship with Velázquez, supporting his work all the time.

Overall, Velázquez's all-encompassing Las Meninas hightlights the techniques in Baroque art, generating a realistic, dramatic scene with subtile interactions with viewers. He also transcended other Baroque art by intelligently adding innovative techniques and ideas to make this painting more interesting. His effort gained him the honor of joining the Order of Santiago, and also inspired many generations to come. Velázquez, King Philip IV and the Count-Duke Olivares created the Golden Age of Spanish Baroque painting. Without Velázquez's skills, or the other two's patronage, we would not have seen such an abundance of breath-taking Spanish Baroque art today.
