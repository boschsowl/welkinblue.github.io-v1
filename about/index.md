### The Other Side of 9 3/4
Hello world, this is ~~the owner of Honeydukes @ Hogsmeade~~ Jianing. I'm a CmpE student at [Vanderbilt University](http://www.vanderbilt.edu). I live multiple lives.

- Developer
- Art history lover/Freelance artist
- Bibliophile
- Gamer
- Story writer, occasionally
- Wanderlust
- Undergrad researcher @ [STORM Lab](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/stormlab/)

I have a passion for art (& its history) and technology, because I appreciate and (at least try to) make amazing things. [Bouguereau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau), [Monet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet) and [Arthur Rackham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham) are my favorite artists.
Meanwhile I'm looking into CS graduate programs and trying to figure out what interests me most.
